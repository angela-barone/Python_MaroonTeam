Even though our presentation shows how the code runs, if you would like to replecate our project you must install some modules.

First of all, you need to create a virtual environment. Type in the terminal:  
python3 -m venv C:\Users\...filedestination....\venv (in my case, it was "python3 -m venv C:\Users\angel\OneDrive\Desktop\venv");
Then activate the virtual environment (in my case: "c:/Users/angel/OneDrive/Desktop/Project/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1").
Finally, upgrade pip by typing "pip3 install --upgrade pip".
