# Python_MaroonTeam

Part of the Code First Girls Python Hackathon. We had to create a Brute Force Password Cracker using Ptyhon. 

1) First, we thought it would be interesting to try to 'crack' the password on a password protected PDF file.
For an extra challenge we used Python to create our own password protected PDF from scratch! We used the 'reportlab' module to do this.
We first imported the module, then created a new PDF file called 'Crack_Me.pdf'.
We then added some text before setting the secret password.
